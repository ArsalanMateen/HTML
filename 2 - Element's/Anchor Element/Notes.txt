The <a> HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.


** Attributes **

1. 'href'

The URL that the hyperlink points to. Links are not restricted to HTTP-based URLs â€” they can use any URL scheme supported by browsers;

-- Telephone numbers with tel: 

<a href="tel:+4733378901">
 +47 333 78 901 
</a>

-- Email addresses with mailto:

<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">
  Send email
</a>

-- SMS text messages with sms:

<a href="sms:(countrycode)(number), (countrycode)(number), ...."> 
  Text 
</a>, 

where multiple phone numbers are separated by commas i-e., 

<a href="sms:+911234567890, +11234567890">
  Send a SMS
</a>

2. 'download'

This attribute specifies that the target (the file specified in the href attribute) will be downloaded when a user clicks on the hyperlink. 

The optional value of the 'download' attribute will be the new name of the file after it is downloaded. 

<a href="/images/example.png" download="filename">
  Download Image 
</a>

'filename', Optional. Specifies the new filename for the downloaded file

3. 'target'

The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

 The following keywords have special meanings for where to load the URL:

-- _self:* 

Opens the linked document in the same frame as it was clicked (this is default)

-- _blank:* 

Usually a new tab, but users can configure browsers to open a new window instead.
