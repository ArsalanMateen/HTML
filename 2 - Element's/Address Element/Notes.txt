The <address> HTML element indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.

<address>
  <a href="mailto:@example.com">@example.com</a>
  <br />
  <a href="tel:+14155550132">+1 (415) 555‑0132</a>
</address>

** Usage notes **

-- The <address> element can only be used to represent the contact information for its nearest <article> or <body> element 
ancestor, it means that;

If you place the <address> element inside an <article>, it represents the contact information related to that specific article,
such as the author’s contact details.

If it is outside of an <article> and just inside the <body>, it represents the contact information for the entire website 
or webpage.

-- This element should not contain more information than the contact information, 
like a publication date (which belongs in a <time> element).

-- Typically, an <address> element can be placed inside the <footer> element of the current section, if any.
