The <b> HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, 
which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, 
and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. 

However, you should not use <b> for styling text or granting importance. If you wish to create boldface text, 
you should use the CSS font-weight property. If you wish to indicate an element is of special importance, 
you should use the <strong> element.

** Usage notes **

-- Do not confuse the <b> element with the <strong>, <em>, or <mark> elements. 

The <strong> element represents text of certain importance, <em> puts some emphasis on the text and the <mark> element 
represents text of certain relevance. The <b> element doesn't convey such special semantic information, use it only when no 
others fit.

-- Do not mark titles and headings using the <b> element. For this purpose, use the h1 to h6 tags.

-- It is a good practice to use the class attribute on the <b> element in order to convey additional semantic information as 
needed (for example; <b class="highlight"> Important keywords or phrases </b> within the text are highlighted to draw attention).

-- Historically, the <b> element was meant to make text boldface. Styling information has been deprecated since HTML4, 
so the meaning of the <b> element has been changed
